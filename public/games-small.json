    "Body": "# How to play\n\n## Just put your hand on the wasd and mouse.\n\n_ You will play a number of small games (very few). They are controlled with the mouse or wasd. You only have 10 seconds to figure out how to play each game and play it. Relax, they're all very simple and you don't need to finish every game, you just need spend 10 seconds on it! _\n\n# About the game\n\u003e(Contains spoilers, playing the game first)\n\nThe aim of making this game was to make something enjoyable.\n\n\nThese minigames are very simple, while contain tricks that may give you a little surprise. For example, in the Sokoban level the boxes explode when three of them connected in a line. \n\nSome of the mini-games have a lot of potential, such as Sokoban and Wizard. In the original plan they had many levels and would appear many times. But for some reason these were not completed. On the one hand, 48 hours is really too short. On the other hand, I'm not sure if the player can solve the more complex levels in 10 seconds. PUSHBOX2 would have been too complex. Even if you know the correct solution it's hard to finish on time.\n\nWizard is my favourite minigame. Destroy enemies with three special spells. Each spell sounds harmless, but the monsters disappear because of the Match-3 rule, so you can still start a massacre with them.\nUnfortunately only the tutorial level of the wizard was completed. By that time I hadn't slept for 20 hours straight whitch makes me had to turn to some easy games. I think even though taking Sorcerer out on its own would make for a good game. I wonder if you saw the potential of this game in 10 seconds.\n\n\n# Development work\n\nI really like the baba is you art style, where everything is wigglling. I think a shader witch makes the textures shift according to the noise can do this. But I chose the dumbest way. draw all the art assets three times. Three times! Hope it is worth.\n\n\nThe code work was very stifling. The first few hours I was doing some framework stuff like scene switching and cleaning up all the sprites at the end of the level. The work was pretty easy until I got to the minigames development stage. First of all, there were a lot of games that needed to be developed in original plan. It would take me hours to create one minigame, and that would only allow the player to play it for 10 seconds. For most of the time, there was no end in sight because even if I spent a super long time on a minigame, the whole game flowed still less than one minute. It was the hardest gamejam I've ever joined, but thank goodness it was finally finished. Barely finished, because there were only 10 minigames.If you were amused during the playthrough, it means my work was not in vain. \n\n![ld51.gif](///raw/b5d/34/z/51cfd.gif)",

    "Body": "\"Say something.\" Every 10 seconds.\n\n*A game barely made for Ludum Dare 51 Compo.*\n\nA card game about conversation, where you must say (play) something every 10 seconds! Play as Black, the discommunicative communicator, half-way coerced into a practice session with Red. Watch your partner's intents and keep the conversation going!\n\nThe game doesn't have BGM or any actual card art due to lack of time.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe game has a short integrated intro, but as a quick reminder just in case:\n\n### Game flow\n\n- Every 10 seconds, both parties take a simutaneous turn. Whenever a turn starts, everyone draws a card from their Deck.\n- Click on a card in your Hand (bottom-left) to select it. Selected cards are moved to your side of the Field (middle-left), from where it will be played at end of turn.\n- Only one card can be on each side of the Field at the same time. If you would select another card while there already is one, the card you clicked on would replace the one currently on the Field.\n- Each turn, when the timer runs out, the turn ends and the following happens:\n    - For each side of the Field, if it's empty, an \"Awkward Silence\" is generated and put there automatically. Not acting is itself an action!\n    - Effects on cards resolve.\n    - You gain or lost score equal to the sum of both cards' Values, depending on their Types. See below.\n    - Cards on the Field are moved to their owners' respective Discard piles.\n    - Everyone discards their leftmost cards to hand size (9).\n\n### Card attributes\n\n- Each card has a Type and a Value:\n    - Assertive cards are yellow. They are signified by upward-arrow symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n    - Receptive cards are blue. They are signified by downward-arrow symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n    - Deflective cards are pale. They are signified by hourglass symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n- Matches and Clashes:\n    - Assertive and Receptive cards Match with each other. Each Match made on the Field increases your score by the sum of the Value of both cards.\n    - Assertive and Assertive cards Clash with each other, so do Receptive cards with others of their kind. Each Clash made on the Field *decreases* your score by the sum of the Value of both cards.\n    - Deflective cards do not Match or Clash, but have negative value.\n- Each card also has a *Level*, represented as the number within the red circle, in the top-left corner of cards. Cards can only be played if the current *Conversation Level*, shown on the score meter located at the middle-right of the screen, is higher than its own level.\n\n### Trivia\n\n- Red always reveals the card she puts onto the Field at the start of turn. She's nice!\n\n## Tools\n\n- Godot Engine w/ Rust bindings\n- Krita\n- ChipTone for the very few sound effects\n\n## Fonts\n\nThis project redistributes multiple fonts by jeti (https://fontenddev.com/fonts/), licensed under CC BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n- Cartridge by jeti\n- Five by Five by jeti\n- Kapel by jeti\n- Lunch Menu by jeti\n- Microserif by jeti\n- Peanut Money by jeti\n- Squarewave by jeti\n- Poco by jeti\n",

And every ten seconds, those cursed ghosts float for their non-lives, not to be brought by the Mighty Claw to one of the coloured gods as assorted offerings.\n\nWhere do you fit in this? Well, you play as the claw.\n\nAn arcade-styled speedy short-term memory game. *Pac-Man* meets red light, green light.\n\nSome more information (not that much!) is in the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/Mossieur_Patate/ludum-dare-51/-/blob/master/README.md) from the GitLab repository, especially some ideas I have.\n\n### How to play\n\nThe game alternates between ‚Äònight‚Äô and ‚Äòday‚Äô phases. During the night, you can observe the colours of the ghosts; during the day, you can grab and release ghosts. The goal is to release ghosts on the sideway receivers (the four static coloured Pac-Mans), matching the colours. The target number of ghosts is indicated in the upper-left corner (‚ÄòSacrifices‚Äô), while the remaining number of full night-day cycles is indicated right to the Power Pellet icon (also in the upper-left corner). *[In version 1.1, ‚ÄòHarvest‚Äô.]*\n\nThere is no maximum level, the game goes on (until level 49, see below). *[In version 1.1, the game goes back to level 1 after level 38.]*\n\n**COLOURBLIND MODE:** in colourblind mode, numbers get displayed to make up for colours (both on daytime ghosts and receivers).\n\n### Controls\n\n* **Arrow keys** to move the claw\n* **Space** to catch/release a ghost\n\n![Gameplay.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50103.gif \"Gameplay.\")\n\n![Level 1.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50073.png \"Level 1.\")\n\n![Failure in level 2.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50105.png \"Failure in level 2.\")\n\n![Colourblind mode.](///raw/3d5/84/z/526f9.png \"Colourblind mode.\")\n\n### Platforms\n\n* **Navigator: Disclaimer:** as fullscreen was not working properly, display is just a little different (smaller resolution, and also a small zoom out from v1.0.2). See this [devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/436556/navigator-version) for details about debugging.\n\n* **Linux:** it is somewhat uneasy to provide a one-size-fits-all Linux binary because of the variety of distributions, but using the **.love** file I uploaded, [having Love2D](https://love2d.org) should be enough. There is also a solution involving AppImage, although I could not test it. See [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution#Distribution_for_Linux) for more detail.\n\n### Versions\n\n**(05/10/2022)** Current legitimate Compo version is 1.0.1, which is basically version 1.0 + colourblind mode + level-skipping key.\n\n**(06/10/2022) OUT NOW:** post-Compo version 1.0.2 with better parameters for difficulty steepness and for the ghosts‚Äô ‚Äònight shift‚Äô duration. ;) Although this is really the original version ‚Äòdone right‚Äô‚Ä¶ I am not replacing the original one as I am not sure this would be fair, but you can still take a look if you want to see some more justice done to the game. See [devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/436510/version-102) for details (including better tiles and a difficulty fix). You can also **download** the 1.0.2 navigator version (in case you can make it run somewhere), but take notice that the current itch.io player runs 1.0.1.\n\n**(05/10/2022) HOPEFULLY COMING SOON:** post-Compo version 1.1 with stackable ghosts, and possibly a mode with pre-designed levels. Another idea I had and will try here, which is even simpler to program, is a *Tetris*-like ‚ÄòPanic Mode‚Äô where you get more ghosts with time, and have to take them out as long as possible before the whole space is full. (And also, getting the screen hidden or colours ‚Äòblurred‚Äô for some time as a penalty for holding a ghost at night, which would make more sense than merely getting immobilised.) I am willing to bet I would totally have had the time to make this one for the Jam deadline, and possibly the night of the Compo deadline. **(11/10/2022) OUT NOW:** modes are saved for a future version 1.2, but layers, more challenging difficulty, and a lot of user-friendly details have been added! :) The [mouthful devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/438512/version-11) is there. Once again, **downloading** the 1.1 navigator version is possible. I think things are getting interesting here, stressing again out of fairness that this should **not** be judged as the Compo version, although it can give a hint about the game‚Äôs potential and extensions. (For the record, debugging collisions and shadows was a massive time black hole! This version would have been riddled with occasional front-depth shadows in competition conditions‚Ä¶) Either 1.1 or 1.2 is ‚ÄòJam version done right‚Äô.\n\n\n### A little backstory\n\nI came up very late with the complete idea, while I thought of the cheeky allusion to the famous arcade mechanic very quickly. I would have had the time for the whole layer mechanic and carefully crafted levels based on it (including implicit tutorial progression) had I not had so much trouble with my thought process (I wavered between a whole host of wildly different concepts!); actually, I might have been able to make it in less than one or two hours, and certainly for the Jam deadline, but I wanted to challenge myself for the Compo rules. Playtesting was also minimal with the final conditions, but having a series of increasingly difficult levels is a makeshift solution; the formulae are super easy to tweak, although I am unsure this would count as bug fixing‚Ä¶ (**Edit shortly thereafter:** I simply decreased the number of cycles. This was really one mere instruction and this feels way more reasonable! No change in mechanics.)\n\nI may upload a version with layers elsewhere, so stay tuned if you are interested! :slight_smile: (But not here, as I believe upgraded versions are not authorized even if the original stays available and pinpointed? Not sure, the rules do not say; maybe you know.)\n\n### Tools\n\n* **Framework:** [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)\n\n* **Sound effects:** [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) + [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)\n\n* Nothing else for the **graphics**, as everything here is managed entirely programmatically (except for the icon and thumbnail/cover), and often vectorially. So, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)! :slight_smile:\n\n* As a side note: for [reducing](https://www.iloveimg.com/fr/redimensionner-image) and [compressing](https://www.iloveimg.com/fr/compresser-image) the animated GIF, iLoveIMG is useful.\n\n### Known bugs\n\n[**All solved** in version 1.1]\n\n* Since I (voluntarily) let the grid at a constant size, and since there is no cap on the number of ghosts nor vertical stacking of ghosts programmed, I suspect you will run into an infinite loop if you reach too high a level. (A quick inequation solving leads me to believe this would be level 49. Hey, after all, the original *Pac-Man* had a [notorious bug for level 256](https://atari.fandom.com/wiki/Pac-Man/Level_256)! Mine is just not a cool power-of-2-related one.)\n\n* Ghosts sometimes collide, while they should not. This is only seldom a problem, except maybe in very advanced levels.\n\n* It seems that you sometimes cannot grab a ghost right after having released it. Unsure.\n\n* Not really a bug per say, but display depth is not (yet) handled, so, do not frown if you see a ghost pass behind another one when it should not. Consider it ghost magic. :3\n\n### Known non-bugs\n\n* v1.1: Ghosts will first finish their current movement (including staying still) before falling, in a Wile E. Coyote fashion: this is on purpose. :)\n\n* v1.1: preventing superimposition is dealt with by stacking upwards. See point 35 from the devlog.",

See the version control at the end of the page and download that version if you want.**\n\n![Banner2.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe7.png)\n\n## Instruct commands at specific times to your pal Ev'ry, so it can collect gems and get to its goal in 10 seconds or less.\n\n![image_2022-10-02_210422370.png](///raw/371/a2/z/50016.png)\n![image_2022-10-02_210458290.png](///raw/371/a2/z/50017.png)\n![image_2022-10-02_210527935.png](///raw/371/a2/z/50018.png)\n\nMade by *manta ray* (a.k.a. Jos√© Bonilla, i.e. me) in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 51 *Compo*.\n\n* Version: 1.0.0 (compo)\n* Genre: Puzzle platformer\n* Builds: Windows x64 - Download below and unzip to play\n* Total playtime: 15-20 minutes\n\n\n\n\n![Banner3.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe8.png)\n\nThis game is a **puzzle platformer** in which you do not control the character directly, but rather **instruct it actions** to perform at specific time slots of a 10-second period. You do so by **placing** different **action tiles** in the **timeline**:\n\n![UI-Timeline.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff0.png)\n\nAfter placing tiles there, you can start the commands by pressing the green **Play** button and stop the current run by pressing the **Stop** button. You can also press the **Restart** button to restart the level with a clean slate.\n\n**NOTE: ** There are **7 tutorial levels** and **6 regular levels** in the Compo build. Try to get all three stars in all levels! **The game will save your progress**.\n\nFinally there's an Options button to take you to level select and/or mange options (Sound/Music).\n\n### Controls\n\n* **Mouse Left click** - **place tiles** in the timeline, and generally **interact** with the game UI\n* **Mouse Wheel Up/Down** - scroll and **toggle between available action commands** for Ev'ry (see below). _Also used in the Main Menu for scrolling up/down for the level selection!_\n* **Mouse Right click** - use while over an already placed action in the timeline to remove it.\n\nThe actions you can specify are the following:\n\n* ![UI-Tile.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffff.png) **No action** or empty (doh!). By default all the timeline is empty.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles2.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff2.png) **Walk right**. Ev'ry will keep moving right unless told to stop explicitly.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles3.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff4.png) **Walk left**. Ev'ry will keep moving right unless told to stop explicitly.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles4.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff5.png) **Stop**. Ev'ry will halt all horizontal movement, even while airborne.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles5.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff6.png) **Jump**. Ev'ry will jump, keeping its horizontal **momentum**. If specified while airborne, Ev'ry can also **double jump**.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles6.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff9.png) **Duck**. Ev'ry will duck to avoid hazards and remain ducked until further instructed to do otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n![Banner4.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe9.png)\n\n* **Game Design** by me, relatively inspired by King of Thieves\n* **Coding** by me - GameMaker 2022.8\n* **Art** by me - Aseprite\n* **Music and sounds** composed and performed by me (Roland GP 609 + Audacity)\n* **Font** is *Milky Coffee* by Syafrizal from dafont.com (https://www.dafont.com/milky-coffee.font)\n\n\n\n\n![Banner1.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe6.png)\n\nNote that you **cannot drag and drop** tiles in the timeline.\n\n**UPDATE: A post-compo bug fix version has been released. See below**\n\nThere a a couple of bugs (now fixed in the post-compo bug fix release):\n\n- The **cannons** currently have a **small bug** that does not initialize their timings exactly the same every level restart. This can prove difficult to overcome the levels that contain cannons. If faced with this issue, try your same timeline configuration again several times.\n- Even though there is a **volume slider** in the options menu, it actually **does nothing**. This is a bug.\n- **Tutorial level 5** has a bug in which **certain ceiling tiles are not solid** and they should be.\n\nI **opted out** of the **Humor** category.\n\n**Source code** is included (see LD51.zip).\n\n\n\n\n![Banner5.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffea.png)\n\n* A **Post-Compo 1.0.2 version** has been released, fixing the above bugs and adding very small UI/UX enhancements. If you want to try it out, please go ahead. The bugs are not game-breaking but it's always nicer to play the clean version :)\n\nThe version control can be checked directly on [the Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/biyectivo/ld51/src/main/):\n\n1.0.2\n\n* Fixed a bug found by players on the GUI animations, where clicking restart twice would animate the GUI twice and would position it incorrectly\n* Fixed a bug on Level 5 that was introduced in 1.0.1 in which the timings of the barriers changed making the level impossible to finish.\n\n1.0.1\n\n* Cannon and barriers now reset their state every time, so they are predictable now on every run.\n* Fixed Tutorial Level 5 bug where certain ceiling tiles were not solid.\n* You can now press SPACEBAR to start/stop the timeline.\n* Improved timeline UI so initial selected tile is non-blank to avoid confusion and selected tiles are displayed with transparency to indicate they are not set\n* When levels are finished, current action sequence persists and is no longer wiped out, to allow for easier iteration over the same level. Note that the action sequence does not get permanently stored in the progress data, so quitting the game and restarting it will reset the sequences to blank.\n* Fixed Tutorial Level 5 bug where certain ceiling tiles were not solid.\n* Added Quit button in the title screen\n* Garbage-collected surfaces",

    "Body": "### Hovering Bird\n\nHovering Bird is a table game. The game is played by one player (solo). As the game rules are pretty simple, the game may be suitable even for children.\nThis game was inspired by Flappy Bird mobile game, where the player is tasked to pass through pairs of pipes which appear in equal time intervals (about every 10 seconds).\n\n### What is required\n1. A game field with numbers from 1 to 15 in order (can be easily drawn by hand)\n2. Some token to represent a bird\n3. A standard 52-card deck (with out jokers)\n\nThat's all!\n\n### Gameplay\n\nThe main character (as you already probably guess) is a bird. Player can control the bird, changing the height, where it is flying.\nA game field is served to track the current height.\nNext movement actions are possible:\n1. FLAP: bird flies up, moves up by 3\n2. HOVER: bird spreads its wings and hovers, moves down by 1\n3. DO NOTHING: bird falls down due to gravity, moves down by 2\n\n\n### Game start\n1. Put game field on the table\n2. Put Bird token on game field into any desired cell\n3. Shuffle the deck\n\n### Checkpoints\n\nEach card which will be dealt from the deck represents a checkpoint. Value of the card means height, which bird should reach.\nFor cards from 2 to 10 value corresponds to the rank, Jack means 11, Queen means 12, King means 13, Ace means 1 or 14 (player can reach either 1 or 14 to hit this checkpoint).\nIf bird reaches required height, then corresponding card should be taken away from the table.\nIf player hits checkpoint, he moves again. \nCheckpoints may be hit in any order.\nPlayer can hit only one checkpoint at a time (in case if several cards of the same rank were dealt).\n\n### Move order\n1. One card is dealt from the deck\n2. Player moves the bird (according to the movement rules)\n3. If player hit any checkpoint, he takes corresponding card away and should move again\n\n### Game over\n\nThere cannot be more than 3 cards (checkpoints) active at any moment. \nIf the 4th card should be dealt, then game is over. In this case, count the number of cards which were taken away before, this is your number of points!\n\n\n\nHere is short video example of game play:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzLar5MmU08\n\nGood luck!\n",

Use the mixed up letters on the first line to form a word on the bottom line.  You have 10 seconds to guess a word.  I took some inspiration from Wordle but implementing a static set of words each day.  So each day you play you will get a new set of words (changes as approximately midnight your local time).  You can type, drag-drop, or simply click the letters to place them.  Gain points for correct guess, lose them for incorrect guesses.  A wrong guess with a letter in the correct spot awards a couple seconds of extra time.  Bonus points on correct guesses for each second left on the clock.\n\nYou can see your attempts in the left pane.  Underlined letters are in the correct place.  If you miss a word entirely, it'll show up in italic letters.\n\nThe first word is always 3 letters but it gets progressively more difficult.\n\nI have a huge document outlining new modes and features I want to add, so I fully expect to make this my current free time project.\n\nAs of 5 hours from deadline, I have also added sound!  Not the best sounds admittedly but sound nonetheless.  I've learned from previous entries and included a volume slider on the start-up screen as well.  Thought about some music but alas Bosca Ceoil is the only thing I was familiar with and it is apparently broken.\n\nhttps://simplepotential.com/projects/LD51/game.htm\n\n![titlescreen.png](///raw/384/z/4f566.png)\n![game1.png](///raw/384/z/4f567.png)\n\nMade entirely in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nUpdate 10/8/22:  Some of my play-testers have reported seeing the same word appear from a previous day.  I do not believe this is a bug but rather a result of a small word set for the longer words in my dictionary file.  The seed does appear to be working properly it just happens to be selecting the same words.  I'll be increasing the size of the dictionary at a later date as well as seeing if I can prevent same words on consecutive days.  If you know of any larger word files available for free, please let me know, most of the ones I've looked at will require a lot of clean-up effort.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n",

Be careful, he has bills to pay every 10 seconds, so you should hurry up !\n\n- Find items and sell them to the chest.\n- Rent tools by interacting with the chest empty-handed. You will be able to do more actions but each tool rented increases the bill.\n- Find gold items to maximize your profit !\n- **Find special interactions** (A small hint for you who read descriptions : Purple Flowers kill Monsters ;) ) \n\n## Game guide (Spoilers)\n\nAfter the feedback I received (thank you all!) I figured it could be interesting for a testing purpose to give you a cheat sheet of the not obvious behaviors and interactions you can experience in the game. I highly recommend you to try the game before reading this small guide, since it will spoil you. One of the objective of the game is to discover things by yourself, and this objective is completely ruined by this guide.\n\n[Link to the guide (Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15pjTTjetS5IH_9ORGkk0NWI-Y1m73cuJaXYYcVedbrg/)\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/845/94/z/4f8c0.png)\n\nControls: (Keyboard - Controller)\nSpace - ABXY : Interact\nWASD/Arrows - Left Joystick : Move\nQ/E - L/R : Change Slot\nEsc/P - Start : Pause\nM : Mute/Unmute\n\nThis is the first time I participate in a game jam, and the first game I have ever made with Godot. I am glad I made it in time, even though the game is very modest. I joined as a way to learn by practicing, and I am satisfied with what I got.\n\n\n# AFTER LAUNCH PATCH:\n## Patch 1.1:\nAfter a few friends tested the game, it was clear that the amounts and values of pickup items were too high. Hence, I updated the game with few values changed.\n### Spoiler alert\n- Flowers only give 1 if the player is not using a Hoe (before: amount represented by the flower sprite)\n- Change spawn amount of each flower (except Gold and Quenouille) to 6 (before 12 or 8)\n- Bushes gives 4 - 5 berries if the player is using a sword or axe (before: 2 - 5)\n- Bushes gives 2 - 6 berries if the player is not using a sword or axe (before: 2 - 5)\n- Monsters gives 2 - 5 monster fertilizers (before: 1 - 4)\n- Values: \n  - Heart Flower: 10 -\u003e 5\n  - Purple Flower: 5 -\u003e 4\n  - Quenouille: 10 -\u003e 8\n  - Fish: 10 -\u003e 8\n- Fixed game not restarting after Congratulations screen\n\nYou can still play the original version of the game and consider it as an \"Easier\" mode, however it was too simple to just pickup everything without tools and complete the game in less than a minute.\n\n## Patch 2.0\nI spent some more time after the event to polish the game a little bit more following feedbacks I got. Since this update brings a lot more than just balance tweaks or bug fixes, please don't play it before you've rated the game. Its changelog and release are on the GitHub page.",

The three bars on the top represent your stats for each elemental damage. Each gun uses a different damage type so using guns that you have the highest stats for will give you an edge in combat.",

I streamed the process live at https://twitch.tv/astrayrae.\n\n\n### How to play:\n\n- Drag attacks around until you feel happy.\n\n### Example play:\nhttps://youtu.be/B_mRTPY2qxs\n\n\n### Things that I would have liked to have had time for\nIn decreasing order of importance:\n- Not have \"(Clone)\" stand behind every dang card... Yeah kinda forgot about that.\n- Sound!\n- More Effect Variation\n- Grass / Rocks, current the ground is a bit empty\n- Interface improvements (icons for the card effects, make clearer that cards outside the panel are still active)\n- Letting the player move the cards in the left panel around. It only half works, so I turned it off.\n- More effects, target types (cones), just more card parts. \n- Auto generation of cards, currently every card is manually set up (and some are kinda op).\n- Lighting\n- More enemy variation, more enemies, armored enemies etc.\n- Making the different defenders do different stuff/ be good at different things.\n- More Progression\n",
